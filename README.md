<h1>Code First Girls project (Aug 2020)</h1>

I created this site as part of the Code First Girls introduction to web development course. As you might be able to tell, I'm a dog lover. 🐶

My focus was on learning how to implement the JavaScript elements, so the site is lacking a lot of styling! If I had more time on the project I would: 
<ul>
<li>Make sure the images in the slider were responsive, or swap the slider out completely at mobile size📱</li>
<li>Implement a proper nav bar with hover states 🚁 </li>
<li>Improve the styling across the site 🎁</li>
</ul>

This was my first rodeo implemting all elements of JavaScript from scratch.🤠 
Now I'm improving my skills by working through FreeCodeCamp and Codewars.
